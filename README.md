# High-Performance WebFlux Server with Kotlin Load Testing Client

A high-performance reactive web server built with Spring WebFlux, capable of handling 50,000+ concurrent requests per second. This project includes both a Java-based WebFlux server and a Kotlin-based load testing client that can generate and monitor 1 million HTTP requests.

## üöÄ Performance Highlights

Recent benchmark results show impressive performance:
- Processing 1 million requests in 19 seconds
- Achieving 51,187 requests per second
- 100% success rate with zero failures
- Average response time of 1.91ms
- 99.93% of requests completed under 100ms

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Java WebFlux Server**
   - Built with Spring WebFlux and Netty
   - Optimized for high concurrency using event-loop architecture
   - Efficient metrics collection and monitoring
   - Non-blocking reactive processing pipeline

2. **Kotlin Load Testing Client**
   - Coroutine-based concurrent request generation
   - Real-time metrics collection and progress monitoring
   - Detailed performance analytics and reporting
   - Efficient memory management for large-scale testing
